# Code-Abhyas Event (Apirl)

Code-Abhyas was an event organized by the Coding Connoisseurs from the University of Lucknow. It was a coding competition that tested the programming skills of the participants.

The event had several problem statements that the participants had to solve using their programming skills. The problem statements were designed to test the participants' knowledge of various programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and logic.

## Problem Statements

Here are the problem statements that were given in the Code-Abhyas event:

1. <strong>Palindrome Check</strong> : Given a number n, check whether it is a palindrome number or not.
2. <strong>Josephus Problem </strong>: There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle until only the last person remains. Given the total number of persons n and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person is killed in a circle, find the position of the last survivor.
3. <strong>Rope Cutting Problem</strong> : Given a rope of length N meters, and the rope can be cut in only 3 sizes A, B and C. The task is to maximizes the number of cuts in rope. If it is impossible to make cut then print the number else print -1.
4. <strong>Sum of Digits</strong> : Given a number, we need to find sum of its digits using recursion.
